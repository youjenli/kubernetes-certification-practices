# Create a file called username with the value admin:
# echo -n admin > username

# Get the value of mysecret2

# Create an nginx pod that mounts the secret mysecret2 in a volume on path /etc/foo

# Create a Secret named 'ext-service-secret' in the namespace 'secret-ops'. Then, provide the key-value pair API_KEY=LmLHbYhsgWZwNifiqaRorH8T as literal.

# Consuming the Secret. Create a Pod named 'consumer' with the image 'nginx' in the namespace 'secret-ops' and consume the Secret as an environment variable. Then, open an interactive shell to the Pod, and print all environment variables.

# Create a Secret named 'my-secret' of type 'kubernetes.io/ssh-auth' in the namespace 'secret-ops'. Define a single key named 'ssh-privatekey', and point it to the file 'id_rsa' in this directory.

# Create a Pod named 'consumer' with the image 'nginx' in the namespace 'secret-ops', and consume the Secret as Volume. Mount the Secret as Volume to the path /var/app with read-only access. Open an interactive shell to the Pod, and render the contents of the file.
