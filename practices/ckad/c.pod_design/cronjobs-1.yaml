# Create a cron job with image busybox that runs on a schedule of "*/1 * * * *" and writes 'date; echo Hello from the Kubernetes cluster' to standard output
# k create cronjob busybox --image=busybox --schedule="*/1 * * * *" -- /bin/sh -c "date; echo Hello from the kubernetes cluster"

# See its logs and delete it
# k describe cronjob busybox

# Create the same cron job again, and watch the status. Once it ran, check which job ran by the created cron job. Check the log, and delete the cron job

# Create a cron job with image busybox that runs every minute and writes 'date; echo Hello from the Kubernetes cluster' to standard output. The cron job should be terminated if it successfully starts but takes more than 12 seconds to complete execution.
